# Giveaway-bot
An easy to use open source giveaway bot using discord buttons and Slash commands, and mongoose as database.
Without using any npm libraries like `discord-giveaway`, this project was made from scratch

## Credits 
This source code is created by Natalia, and If using this code, please make sure to credit me!

## Requirements
To use this open source, you will need:
- To install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16 or higher
- To create a mongodb connection 
- Basic mongoose knowledge, if you don't know how to use mongodb I recommend learning before using this source.
- JS knowledge
- DiscordJS knowledge 

## How to install 
To install the bot you will need
- To install the dependencies `ms` `discord.js` `glob` `mongoose`
You can do that by passing:
```
npm install 
```
Or 
```
npm install discord.js glob mongoose ms 
```
- Create a [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) connection
- Change `example.config.json` to `config.json`, and fill the information
```
{
    "token": "Your bot token here",
    "prefix": "Your bot prefix",
    "mongooseConnectionString": "your mongodb connection url"
}
```
- Start the bot 
```
node index.js
```

## Hosting the bot 
replit is not recommended to host the bot, since it needs a database.
